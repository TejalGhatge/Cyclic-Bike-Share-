The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n\n### Stakeholders\n* Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself     apart by also offering reclining bikes,hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with   disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes;       about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use       them to commute to work each day.\n* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and       initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n* Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting   data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning       about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve   them.\n* Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended   marketing program.\n\n### About the company\nIn 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.\n\n### ASK\nFollowing questions will guide the marketing team to set future strategy:\n\n* How do annual members and casual riders use cyclistic bike differently ?\n* Why would casual riders buy cyclictic annual memberships?\n* How could casual riders use social media to influence casual riders to be members?\n\nMoreno has assigned you the first question to answer : How do annual members and casual riders use cyclistic bike differently?\n\nYou will produce the report with following deliveribles:\n* A clear statement of business task.\n* A description of data sources used.\n* Documentation of any cleaning and manipulation of data.\n* A summary of your analysis.\n* Supporting visualizations and key findings\n* Your top three recommendations based on your analysis.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"----------------------------------------\n## Case Study Roadmap -ASK\n----------------------------------------\n* I am trying to gain insights on Cyclistic Company data to see the patterns how the casual riders and annual members use bike differently and develop strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.\n* The conversion of casual to members will provide more profit to the company to rise high in financial standards. The visualization can help to make meaningful insights and impactful marketing strategies.\n\n----------------------------------------\n**Business Task** - *To identify how cyclistic bikeshare casual riders and annual members use their bikes by analyzing their historical bike trip data so as to recommend a new strategy to the marketing team aiming to convert the casual members to subscribed members.*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## PREPARE\n------------------------------------------------------------\nYou will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. Download the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nThe data to be used in this case study is [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).\n\nThe data is arranged monthly and at the last quarterly as well.
